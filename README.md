# S3 Static Site + HTTPS with CloudFront

Basic resume that is uploaded to AWS S3 and then accessed via CloudFront for custom domain and SSL certificates. 

## Steps

The steps I expect to take are:

    1. Use the basic S3-staticsite resume
    2. Upload to bucket
    3. Configure subdomain with Route 53
    4. Configure CloudFront
    5. Document the process along the way.
